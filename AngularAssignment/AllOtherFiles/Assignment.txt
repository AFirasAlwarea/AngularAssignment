Angular
Your assignment is to build a Single Page Application (SPA) that serves as a CMS for a database (a web-based interface for interacting with data inside a database).	
The page should have a list of people, which when clicked on will show detailed information about that person (an image, their full name, email, phone number and so on…). This data should be possible to change, and doing so should update the database backing the page.

Required Features:
• The page should be in two parts:
        ○ One list that shows all the people in the database (sortable by first name, last name and country)
        ○ One view that shows all the information related to the person selected in the list.
• The detail view should have a button that lets you change the information stored about that person, as well as delete that person from the view.
• You should also be able to create a new person through the details view.

Optional:
• The list and details view should be shown side by side if the viewer’s monitor is big enough – otherwise it should switch to a tab-based view.

Code Requirements:
• Interactions should use AJAX, in order to not refresh the page. 
• The list should be generated through a JSON action, while the details view should be a Partial View.
• Data should be possible to validate through an AngularJS controller.
• Countries should be loaded from an enumeration on the server, loaded through an AJAX request.
